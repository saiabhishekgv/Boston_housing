STEPS PERFORMED:
In this project, I have applied apply basic machine learning concepts on data collected for housing prices in the Boston, Massachusetts area to predict the selling price of a new home. 
Firstly, I have explored the data to obtain important features and descriptive statistics about the dataset. 
Next, I made a proper split for the given dataset into testing and training subsets, and determine a suitable performance metric for this problem. 
Then analyzing performance graphs for a learning algorithm with varying parameters and training set sizes. 
This enabled me to pick the optimal model that best generalizes for unseen data. 
Finally, I have tested this optimal model on a new sample and compare the predicted selling price to your statistics.
